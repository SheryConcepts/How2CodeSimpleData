The goal of this unit is to be able to design data definitions. Be able understand how real world problems can be translated
into data form, in a sense, that we have a problem and problem domain.

Data Definitions:
----------------
	Data definitions explain how information is represented as data.
	It consists of type definition, examples, interpretaition and template.
	Type Definition: It defines new type of data and how to form that data.
	Interpret: how interpret that data in correspondence with information. 
	Examples: a few examples of data type.
	Template: It is a one argument function that works on defined data. It helps us understand how data
		  will be used in function.
