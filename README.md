# How2CodeSimpleData
 So, these are assignments that I completed in UBCx HTC1 course.
 Course gave me a different perspective to programming. And it makes you really think how simple recipes can help you solve complex problems.
 Converting real or imagined information into data is skill that every program must have, And this course really teach you that. From designing data definitions to designing Wolrds
 I learnt a lot. I did all that without even using a loop or assigning/re-assigning any variable.
 Looking forward to part 2 of this course.
